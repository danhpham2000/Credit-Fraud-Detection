# Credit-Fraud-Detection
# Project description: It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
# Project goal: Detect the fraudulent in credit card using machine learning

<strong>Phase 1:</strong> Planned the strategies to develop the credit card fraud detection system in Python and PostgreSQL (In progress) </br> 
<strong>Phase 2:</strong> Conduct EDA to find the key patterns for the fraud
<strong>Phase 3:</strong> Preprocess data including handle missing value, remove unnecessary columns and rows
<strong>Phase 4:</strong> Implement machine learning algorithm to predict with the desired of 90% and above
<strong>Phase 5:</strong> Utilized hyperparameter optimization to add additional accuracy to improve better performance


<h1>Note: The project is being developed so it is not visible at the moment, expected 2 weeks to complete</h1>
