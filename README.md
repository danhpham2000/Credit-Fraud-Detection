# Credit-Fraud-Detection
### Project description: It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
### Project goal: Detect the fraudulent in credit card using machine learning

<strong>Phase 1:</strong> Planned the strategies to develop the credit card fraud detection system in Python and PostgreSQL. Extract credit data from Kaggle with over 1,200,000 credit records (Completed) </br> 
<strong>Phase 2:</strong> Conduct EDA to find the key patterns for the fraud (Completed) </br> 
<strong>Phase 3:</strong> Preprocess data including handle missing value, remove unnecessary columns and rows (Completed)</br> 
<strong>Phase 4:</strong> Implement machine learning algorithm to predict with the desired of 90% and above(Completed) </br>
